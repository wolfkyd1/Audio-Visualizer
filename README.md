## Installation

### Local Usage
1. Download the `audio-visualizer.html` file
2. Open directly in a web browser
3. No additional dependencies required

### Web Hosting
1. Upload the HTML file to any web server
2. Ensure HTTPS for microphone access
3. No build process or compilation needed

## Customization

### Modifying Color Themes
Edit the `colorThemes` object in the JavaScript code:

```javascript
this.colorThemes = {
    custom: { 
        primary: 0xff0000,    // Red
        secondary: 0x00ff00,  // Green  
        accent: 0x0000ff      // Blue
    }
};
```

### Adding New Modes
1. Create a new visualizer class extending the base pattern
2. Add mode to `modeControls` and `modeDefaults` objects
3. Include in the switch statement in `switchVisualizer()`

### Performance Tuning
Adjust these variables for different hardware:
- `segmentCount` - Number of tunnel segments
- `particleCount` - Total particles rendered
- `fftSize` - Audio analysis resolution (1024-8192)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
